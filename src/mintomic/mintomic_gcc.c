//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why not implement 64-bit atomics as inline assembly, like the 32-bit atomics?
// Mainly because in current versions of LLVM, the compiler does not accept the %H0 operand
// in inline assembly. For example, using Xcode 4.5 using iOS SDK 6.0,
// both compilers were tried in the project settings: Apple LLVM compiler 4.1, and LLVM GCC 4.2.
// Apparently, others have had this problem with LLVM as well. There is no way to tell LLVM that 64-bit
// integers passed to an asm block belong in an even/odd number pair, as ldrexd/strexd instructions require.
// http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0360e/CHDCHAJF.html
// http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20110523/121381.html
// http://markmail.org/thread/tvhxyvhrfuhonued
//
// Why not implement 64-bit atomics as inline assembly, but only for GCC?
// That doesn't work when compiling for the "old" ABI.
// For example, Xcode 3.2.5 using GCC 4.2 and iPhoneOS SDK 4.2.
// There's no way to make GCC allocate registers for an asm block in an even/odd number pair.
// (Actually, Debug builds appear to allocate registers that way by default, but not Release.)
//
// Why not implement 64-bit atomics as inline C functions using LLVM's ldrexd/strexd intrinsics,
// which were added around May 2011, (see above link), if those are available? (eg. in Xcode 4.5.)
// That works, but the resulting code seems quite large. Not sure it performs better than the
// implementations below, or if it's worth having two implementations. Worth benchmarking.
//
// For iOS devices, why not use Apple's native atomics?
// http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/atomic.3.html
// Also viable, but would need to investigate the code generation.
// Not sure the extra implementation is worth it.
//
// Instead, the following standalone functions ought to work on every GCC-like compiler, including LLVM,
// on a wide range of ARM devices. The tradeoff is that the functions are not inlined.
//
// If these functions are to be optimized further using one of the previously mentioned
// approaches and inlining, it would be good to have benchmark data to support the optimization,
// such as by comparing the minimum timings from a large set of Mintomic test suite runs.
